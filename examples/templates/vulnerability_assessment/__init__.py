"""
Passive Vulnerability Assessment - OSINT-based security scanning with risk grades.

Performs non-intrusive security scanning (SSL/TLS, HTTP headers, DNS, ports, tech stack,
subdomains) on a target domain and produces letter-grade risk scores (A-F) per category
with a developer-focused vulnerability report. Features human-in-the-loop checkpoints
and a forever-alive loop for continuous assessments.
